1. INTRODUCTION INCLUDING PROBLEM STATEMENT
Typing is the basic command to run a computer and your typing speed plays vital role while 
working in computer to save time. Here we have presented a MOBO Typing Project to measure 
user’s typing speed and to enhance their typing speed. 
Nowadays computer skills are necessary to survive in the world because computers are involved 
in every aspect of our life. A good typing speed and accuracy is the most common skill to have 
which help user increase their productivity and opportunities but for different reasons, most people 
can't afford a Computer or Laptop to learn this skill. So we build an android app that helps users 
to learn this skill by simply connecting an ‘OTG’ and ‘External Keyboard’ to their Phones. It has 
different lessons from basic characters to advance words this app not only teaches you how to type 
without looking at the keyboard but helps you to increase your accuracy and speed. 
“MOBO TYPING” is an Android app that is created to help those who have no resources for 
basic computer literacy. It is a standalone touch typing app which is solely created to cater offline 
user who don't have luxury to afford a monthly data pack or lives in out of coverage areas.
2. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT 
Keyboarding is the penmanship of the computer age, and it is extremely important to encourage 
and develop good keyboarding habits right from the start. We will allow our users to explore the 
world of keyboarding. Early practice and repetition that focuses on proper keyboarding technique, 
accuracy and speed will help you become more comfortable on the computer.
OBJECTIVE: To learn the key position of each letter and to type without looking at the 
keys or your hands!
1. Use the correct finger to strike each key.
2. Do not look at your hands while typing. (Memorize keyboard reaches.)
3. Sit up straight and keep feet flat on the floor.
4. Keep home row fingers touching the home row keys; even during a difficult reach
Several apps are built over time for touch typing lessons but our app is different in a way that it 
can work offline and custom tailored for those who cannot afford a PC but still wish to learn typing 
or improve their modern penmanship for improving their efficiency. Only a keyboard and an 
‘OTG’ On the go cable is required along with an android phone for this application, and in no time 
you can start learn to Touch Type and improve substantially and enhance your existing skills, we'll 
be providing several word and paragraph drills and exercises to make sure user get's comfortable 
with all types of key combinations and can type them accurately.
2.1DIFFERENT MODES
1. Single word mode : In single word mode user can focus on single word.
2. Paragraph mode : In paragraph mode user can type full paragraph text to solidify their 
learning.
3. TOOLS/ PLATFORM, HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE 
REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS.
1. Android device with android version above 5.0
2. OTG adapter
3. Java(back end) & xml(front end)
4. Android Studio (ide)
5. External keyboard
4. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT (MARKET POTENTIAL AND 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE).
There are many online typing software available in the market but Mobo Typing is the one and 
only offline standalone typing software which does not require any internet connectivity, step-by step instruction for further progress and it has a very simple UI. In conclusion, we see great value 
in this app providing relatively free alternative to learn typing . By releasing our app and dataset, 
we hope to help those which are not at advantage and to encourage more users to get familiar with 
technology.
